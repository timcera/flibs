<h2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p>

The component <em>m_fileunit</em> provides services to manage fortran file units.

<h2><a name="overview">OVERVIEW</a></h2>
<p>

The function fileunit_getfreeunit returns an integer representing
a fortran unit which is available for opening a file.
The typical use of this function is to manage the files dynamically,
without any database of file units in the library/software.
In the following example, one opens a file with a dynamical
file unit.

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
    integer :: fileunit
    fileunit = fileunit_getfreeunit ()
    open ( unit = fileunit , file = &quot;data.txt&quot; )
    [lb]etc...[rb]
</pre></td></tr></table></p>

If several files are to be opened, the &quot;fileunit_getfreeunit&quot;
method has to be inserted between the &quot;open&quot; statements.
This is because two consecutive calls to &quot;fileunit_getfreeunit&quot;
will return the same integer, as expected : if a unit is available
the first time, it will also be available the second time.
In the following example, several files are opened and connected
to several files.

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
    integer :: fileunit1
    integer :: fileunit2
    fileunit1 = fileunit_getfreeunit ()
    open ( unit = fileunit1 , file = &quot;data.txt&quot; )
    fileunit2 = fileunit_getfreeunit ()
    open ( unit = fileunit2 , file = &quot;data2.txt&quot; )
    [lb]etc...[rb]
</pre></td></tr></table></p>

In a large fortran software, it may be difficult to see if some
bug has been introduced in the file management, especially
when the software is the composition of several libraries.
The subroutines fileunit_getallopen , fileunit_closeallopen ,
fileunit_report , fileunit_displayopen allow to manage for
the units currently used in the software.
The fileunit_getallopen returns an array of integers which
contains all the currently opened units. The fileunit_closeallopen
subroutine close all currently opened units. The fileunit_report
displays a full report about a given unit number by using the
&quot;inquire&quot; fortran intrinsic statement.

<h2><a name="todo">TODO</a></h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> allow to &quot;lock&quot; a collection of logical units, so that an
 external library which may use constant units can be linked.
<br><br>
<li> allow to &quot;unlock&quot; one unit, or all units at once.
</ul>
