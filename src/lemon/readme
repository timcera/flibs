FLEMON:
-------

Adaptation of the lemon parser by D. Richard Hipp for Fortran.
Generates a Fortran-encoded parser for LALR(1) grammars, much
like Yacc and Bison.

Current limitations and remarks:
- You can not convenient use the extra argument
  (Macros involved are not expanded)
  You can use %include instead to make a "global" variable
  to hold the state.
- You need to use %include to _use_ a module with the type definitions
  for the token data (type(parsetokentype)) or put the definition
  in the %include statement. Do not forget to make it public!
