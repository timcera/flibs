Compiling the Fortran interface to the Sqlite3 library
------------------------------------------------------

The makefile in this directory contains an explanation
of how to build a library from the sources. This
explanation is geared to:
- UNIX/Linux type platforms (includes Cygwin and MingW
  under Windows and OSX)
- It explains the creation of a static library only

Some of this information is useful for compiling under
MS Windows as well, but the file names are typical for
the UNIX-type platform.

Solved the two problems that I encountered:

- On Windows nmake would fail, building the test programs.
  This was due to the use of the macro "LIB" - this upset
  the list of directories used by the Intel Fortran compiler
  to determine where to get the runtime libraries from

- On Linux extra libraries are required for gfortran -
  libpthread.so and libdl.so. By providing a dedicated
  version of the configuration file for gfortran this is
  now taken care of (the macro EXTRALIBS - it is empty
  for the other platforms)

***Update***

I have adjusted the interfaces from Fortran to C so that
the calling convention/name mangling is no longer of
importance, thanks to the C/Fortran interface features
that were introduced in Fortran 2003.

This makes the building of the library quite a bit simpler.

Furthermore the source for SQLite is now included in the
distribution - version 3.22.0. The most recent version may
of course be found on http://www.sqlite.org

***Update***

As compilers and OSes develop, most notably the move from
32 bits to 64 bits, things can change a lot. The information
in the makefile is partly deprecated. To accommodate for the
Intel Fortran compiler on Windows and the above mentioned
changes, I made some adjustments to the interfacing code.

The practical consequences:
- Define the macro LOWERCASE for compiling csqlite.c for
  the gcc C compiler (Linux, Cygwin and MinGW) in combination
  with the gfortran and Intel Fortran compilers.
- Define the macro UPPERCASE (actually the default) for the
  combination MSVC C/C++ and Intel Fortran compiler on Windows.

(I have not encountered the double underscore convention in
a long time and other variants that were catered for via
the INBETWEEN and FTNCALL macros are no longer abundant either.)
