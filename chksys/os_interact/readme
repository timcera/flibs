Interaction with the operating system
-------------------------------------

This directory contains several programs that have the goal of
probing the interaction with the operating system:

* stopcode.f90:
  Can the STOP statement be used to return a return code to the
  operating system?

  Run the program via chkstop.sh (for Linux, OSX and UNIX like systems)
  or chkstop.bat (for Windows)

* reopen_stdin.f90:
  Can you reopen standard input so that after reading the contents
  of a redirected file, you can interact directly with the user?

  Run the program via reopen.sh (for Linux, OSX and UNIX like systems)
  or reopen.bat (for Windows)
