! compdiag.inp --
!     File with the code for the test programs that are used
!     to analyse the behaviour of the compiler
!     Each test program should be documented using:
!     @desc - short textutal description (also start of
!             new test program)
!     @category - one of:
!              basic     - basic checks of certain aspects
!              advanced  - checks for trickier aspects
!              extension - checks whether popular extensions are
!                          supported
!              f2003     - checks for Fortran 2003 features
!

@desc Does the compiler check the values of keywords to OPEN
@category basic
program check
    open( 10, file = 'check.inp', form = 'nonsense' )
end program

@desc Does the compiler accept FORM="BINARY"
@category extension
program check
    open( 10, file = 'check.inp', form = 'binary' )
end program
