Running the test program:
------------------------

- Start two terminals/DOS-boxes
- In one start the test program as:

  test_ipc_file <file1.inp

- In the other as:

  test_ipc_file <file2.inp

(Similarly the mmap version: test_ipc_mmap <file1.inp)

This ensures that one version sends the information to the other.


Notes on the modules:
--------------------

1. The modules do not include a command yet to set the directory where
   all the files should be

2. The modules require a SLEEP() function/routine that is not native to
   Fortran (or C for that matter). The file-based IPC module relies on a
   compatibility module from Compaq Visual Fortran (also available in
   Intel Fortran). This should be transformed into a more
   compiler-independent form. (It may require a C function though)

3. The ad hoc script "mk" is provided to compile the test program.
   It is a temporary solution.
