! string_operations.f90 --
!     Module for replacing substrings and other operations on strings
!
!     Note:
!     Two versions of the basic routine are supplied:
!     - Replace one particular substring by another string
!     - Replace a set of substrings by corresponding strings
!
!     In principle all substrings are replaced, but you can
!     control this in the first version via an optional
!     argument, taking the values: replace_all, first_only and last_only
!
!     The derived type pair can be used to specify which substring
!     must be replaced by what other string:
!
!     newstring = replace( string, [pair('A', 'a'), pair('B', 'b'), ...])
