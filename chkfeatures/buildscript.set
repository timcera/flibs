# buildscript.inp --
#     Define the names of the source files to be handled and the error messages
#     that should be printed if building the program fails (note: not always
#     a negative thing - the compiler may be checking questionable practices)
#
#     TODO:
#     - allow compiler options via $2 $3 $4 ...
#     - maybe a descriptive string after the file name?
#
#     - submodules
#     - execute_command_line
#     - array operations on large arrays (temporaries can exhaust the stack)
#     - UNICODE
#     - object-oriented features
#     - parametrised derived types
#     - user-defined derived type output
#     - type(integer)
#     - ISO_C_BINDING, IO_FORTRAN_ENV, IEEE_ARITHMETIC (details)
#     - static check on integer values exceeding the limit
#     - warnings and questionable aspects such as unused variables
#       and dummy arguments
#     - Not-a-number
#     - use, intrinsic
#     - new intrinsic routines (Bessel functions for instance - for now: Bessel implemented)
#     - stream access
#     - reading incomplete text files
#     - real(dp) with "accurate" single-precision constant
#     - real(sp) with double-precision constant
#     - contiguous
#     - allocate - source and mold
#     - move_alloc
#     - handling files CRLF or LF
#     - unit for direct access record length
#     - character(len=:) function
#     - protected attribute
#     - support for DECIMAL, ROUND and SIGN
#     - "all" features in the overview tables from Fortran Forum
#
#     - array constructor like ['A', 'BC', 'DEF'] - force a length?
#
#     - extend chk_flush_check - check that the file is not flushed if no flush used.
